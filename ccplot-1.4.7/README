OVERVIEW OF CCPLOT
==================

ccplot is a python program that reads CloudSat, CALISO and Aqua MODIS HDF
and HDF-EOS data files, and produces plots of profile, layer and swath
products.

More information can be found at http://www.ccplot.org/.

2 COLORMAP FILES

ccplot uses a custom colormap file format called cmap. You can find example
cmap files in /usr/share/ccplot/cmap/.

2.1 Writing a custom cmap file

cmap files are simple ASCII files in format:
    
    BOUNDS
    from1 to1 step1
    from2 to2 step2
    ...
    
    TICKS
    from1 to1 step1
    from2 to2 step2
    
    COLORS
    r1 g1 b1 a1
    r2 g2 b2 a2
    ...
    
    UNDER_OVER_BAD_COLORS
    r1 g1 b1 a1
    r2 g2 b2 a2
    r3 g3 b3 a3
    
Where fromn, ton, stepn are floating point numbers, and rn, gn, bn are RGBA
(Red Green Blue Alpha) color components of the n-th color stripe.
Components are expected to be in base 10 format (0-255). All sections
except COLORS are optional.

    * BOUNDS section specifies color mapping regions.

    * TICKS section specifies tick labels to appear on the colorbar.
    
    * COLORS section spefifies RGBA colors of the colormap, one color per line.

    * UNDER_OVER_BAD_COLORS section specifies colors to be used for
      over, under and bad (masked; missing) values in that order.
